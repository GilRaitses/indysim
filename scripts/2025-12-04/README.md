This folder contains dated helper scripts.

The path `scripts/2025-12-04/magatfairy` was previously recorded as a git submodule, but no `.gitmodules` file exists in this repository to provide its URL. That broke automated checkouts that fetch submodules.

If you need `magatfairy`, clone it into `scripts/2025-12-04/magatfairy`:
