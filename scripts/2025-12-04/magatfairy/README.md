This directory is a local-only dependency used for MAGAT data conversion.

It used to be tracked as a git submodule, but this repository does not include a tracked `.gitmodules` file with its URL, which breaks automated checkouts when submodules are enabled.

If you need it locally, clone it into this path:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GilRaitses/magatfairy scripts/2025-12-04/magatfairy
```
