# SCIENTIFIC CONTEXT

positioning_within_neuroscience:
  
  outer_ring_systems_neuroscience:
    description: >
      The study addresses how neural circuits transform sensory input into motor output
      at the systems level. Optogenetic activation of sensory neurons triggers stereotyped
      motor responses that can be quantified as discrete reorientation events.
    contribution: >
      Demonstrates that population-level sensorimotor dynamics follow predictable temporal
      kernels with identifiable timescales for excitation and inhibition.
  
  middle_ring_behavioral_neuroscience:
    description: >
      The study characterizes behavioral habituation in a genetically tractable model organism.
      Repeated optogenetic stimulation produces progressively altered behavioral responses
      quantified as changes in turning fraction across pulse number.
    contribution: >
      Provides quantitative framework for measuring habituation dynamics under controlled
      stimulation protocols with parametric variation in intensity and temporal structure.
  
  inner_ring_neurotheory:
    description: >
      The study applies point process models from computational neuroscience to behavioral
      event data. The gamma-difference kernel represents a biologically interpretable model
      of temporal filtering in sensorimotor transformation.
    contribution: >
      Demonstrates that difference-of-gammas kernels capture excitatory and inhibitory
      timescales that may correspond to distinct neural circuit mechanisms.

  convergence_point:
    statement: >
      This work sits at the intersection where quantitative neurotheory meets behavioral
      measurement meets systems-level circuit function. The kernel parameters provide
      a bridge between circuit timescales and observable behavior.

# NARRATIVE ARC

study_arc:

  original_study:
    question: >
      Can larval reorientation dynamics under optogenetic stimulation be modeled
      as a point process with a parametric temporal kernel?
    answer: >
      Yes. The gamma-difference kernel with two timescales accurately predicts
      population-level PSTH and generalizes across experimental conditions.
    key_finding: >
      Fast excitation with tau_1 = 0.3s and slow suppression with tau_2 = 4s
      govern the temporal dynamics of reorientation probability.

  followup_study:
    question: >
      Can the same kernel be used to phenotype individual larvae based on
      their unique timescale parameters?
    answer: >
      No with current protocols. Sparse data with only 25 events per track
      makes 6-parameter kernel estimation unreliable at the individual level.
    key_finding: >
      Apparent phenotypic clusters are statistical artifacts. Gap statistic
      shows k=1 is optimal. Only 8.6% of tracks show genuine individual differences.

  arc_synthesis:
    statement: >
      Population-level modeling succeeds because pooled data provides sufficient
      statistical power. Individual phenotyping fails because the same model
      is overparameterized for sparse individual data. The solution requires
      either more data per individual or simpler models.

    panels:
      A: PCA distribution showing unimodal structure
      B: Validation failures with ARI below 0.13
      C: Gap statistic minimized at k=1

      True PCA distribution is unimodal. All validation methods fail.
      Gap statistic indicates no discrete clusters exist.
    relationship_to_arc: >
      Central negative result of follow-up study. Apparent clusters are artifacts
      not genuine phenotypes. This motivates all subsequent analysis.

    relationship_to_arc: >
      Primary actionable recommendation. Protocol change is highest leverage
      intervention for enabling individual phenotyping.
    relationship_to_other_figures:

      Simpler phenotypes may be sufficient for many applications.

  high_priority:

    caption_cutoff:
      issue: Several slide captions are cut off at the bottom
      affected_slides: [3, 4, 5, 6]
      solution: Reduce figure height from 0.68 to 0.62 or adjust vspace

    legend_readability:
      issue: Legends in multi-panel figures are too small
      affected_slides: [5, 6, 9, 13]
      solution: Regenerate source figures with larger legend fonts

    faq_visual_aids:
      issue: FAQ slides are text-only walls of text
      affected_slides: [23, 24, 25, 26, 27]
      solution: Add small icons or diagrams to each FAQ slide

  medium_priority:

    repeated_figures:
      issue: Same figures used in multiple slides
      affected_slides: [11 and 17, 9 and 19]
      solution: Create unique variations or zoomed views for each use

    panel_labels:
      issue: Some multi-panel figures have inconsistent or missing panel labels
      affected_slides: [4, 14, 18]
      solution: Add clear A/B/C/D labels to all panels

    color_consistency:
      issue: Color schemes vary between original and follow-up study figures
      affected_slides: [3 vs 12, 5 vs 15]
      solution: Consider unified color palette for presentation

  low_priority:

    transition_slides:
      issue: Abrupt transition from original to follow-up study
      location: Between slides 7 and 8
      solution: Add a transition slide summarizing what worked and what remains

    quantitative_emphasis:
      issue: Key numbers could be more prominent
      examples:
        - tau_1 = 0.3s
        - tau_2 = 4s
        - 100 events required
        - 10x information gain
      solution: Use callout boxes or larger font for key statistics

    recommendation_hierarchy:
      issue: All five recommendations appear equally important
      solution: Visually distinguish primary recommendation from secondary

# OVERALL ASSESSMENT

overall_assessment:
  
  grade: B+
  
  summary: >
    The presentation effectively communicates the scientific narrative from
    population-level success to individual-level failure to recommended solutions.
    The figures are authentic and data-driven. The main weaknesses are visual
    polish issues like caption cutoff and legend size rather than content problems.

  strongest_elements:
    - Clear narrative arc from original study to follow-up
    - Honest assessment of limitations
    - Actionable recommendations
    - Figures use real analysis data not placeholders

  areas_for_improvement:
    - Visual consistency across studies
    - FAQ slides need visual support
    - Repeated figures reduce impact
    - Quantitative takeaways could be more prominent

  recommended_next_steps:
    1: Fix caption cutoff in slides 3-6
    2: Regenerate figures with larger legends
    3: Add visual aids to FAQ slides or reduce to 3 slides
    4: Create unique figure variations for recommendation slides
    5: Add transition slide between original and follow-up sections
