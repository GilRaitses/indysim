Subject: Preprint manuscripts for your feedback

Dear Professor Zhang,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share two preprints I have drafted over the past week from my simulation study and lab research. I would be grateful for any feedback you might have when you have time to review them.

The first manuscript presents the main findings from my simulation study, and the second is a follow-up analysis that extends those results. The follow-up manuscript is essentially complete aside from finalizing figure placement and adding a few additional figures, but the core content is ready for review.

I wish you a wonderful holiday break and a happy new year. Thank you for your excellent course this semester—it has been very valuable for my work.

Best regards,
[Your name]
