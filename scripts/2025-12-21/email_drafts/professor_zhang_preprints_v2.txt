Subject: Two preprint manuscripts for your review

Dear Professor Zhang,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share two preprints I've drafted over the past week from my simulation study and lab research. I would appreciate any feedback you might have when you have a chance to review them.

The first manuscript presents the main findings from my simulation study, and the second is a follow-up analysis building on those results. The follow-up manuscript is nearly complete—I'm still finalizing figure placement and adding a few additional figures, but the core content is ready for review.

I wish you a wonderful holiday break and a happy new year. Thank you again for your excellent course this semester; it has been very helpful for my research.

Best regards,
[Your name]
