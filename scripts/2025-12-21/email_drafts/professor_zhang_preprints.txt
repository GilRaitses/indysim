Subject: Preprint manuscripts for your review

Dear Professor Zhang,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to share with you two preprints I have drafted over the past week from my simulation study and lab research. I would love to get your feedback on these when you have time to look them over.

The first manuscript is from my main simulation study, and the second is a follow-up analysis. The follow-up manuscript is complete aside from finalizing figure placement and adding a few additional figures, but the core content is ready for review.

I wish you a great holiday break and a happy new year. Thank you for your excellent course this semester—it has been very valuable for my work.

Best regards,
[Your name]
