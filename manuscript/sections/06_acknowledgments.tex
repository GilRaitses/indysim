The mechanosensory behavioral assays are part of ongoing research in the
Mihovilovic Skanata NeuroBioPhysics Laboratory at Syracuse University,
which investigates neural computation and sensorimotor integration in
Drosophila larvae. Mason Klein developed the reverse crawl detection
algorithm and behavioral state segmentation methods that formed the
foundation of this analysis. Marc Gershow authored MAGAT Analyzer
(Gershow et al., 2012), used for trajectory extraction and
preprocessing. The simulation modeling components were developed as part
of a Simulation Modeling and Analysis course project under the
instruction of Ki Young Jeong, whose guidance on simulation theory
foundations shaped the methodology.
