# 🚨 CRITICAL FAILURE WARNINGS - NEVER REPEAT THESE ERRORS 🚨
critical_failures:
  catastrophic_turn_rate_error:
    date: "2025-07-07"
    error_type: "FUNDAMENTAL_METHODOLOGY_FAILURE"
    description: "Calculated biologically impossible turn rates (82-100 turns/min) that were 50-90× higher than actual baseline"
    root_causes:
      - "Confused cycle-relative binning with rate per minute calculation"
      - "Failed to normalize by actual observation time"
      - "Applied formula 'count/binsize * 60' incorrectly"
    biological_impossibility:
      - "Calculated 1.66 turns/second (physically impossible for larvae)"
      - "Peak rates of 4.5 turns/second (complete biological impossibility)"
      - "Results 50-90× higher than known project baseline (1.21-1.84 turns/min)"
    never_do_again:
      - "NEVER use cycle-relative binning and call it 'rate per minute'"
      - "NEVER skip normalization by total observation time"
      - "NEVER present results without biological validation"
      - "NEVER ignore when results are >30 turns/min (error indicator)"
      - "NEVER proceed without validating against project baseline data"

# CORRECT METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS
correct_turn_rate_methodology:
  individual_track_calculation:
    formula: "track_rate = total_reorientations / (track_duration_minutes)"
    validation: "Must be <30 turns/min and within 1.1-11.4 turns/min biological range"
  population_statistics:
    mean_calculation: "mean(individual_track_rates)"
    error_calculation: "std(individual_track_rates) / sqrt(num_tracks)"
  biological_validation_mandatory:
    baseline_range: "1.1-1.9 turns/min (project data)"
    stimulus_response: "2.2-11.4 turns/min (2-6× baseline)"
    error_threshold: ">30 turns/min indicates calculation error"

# MANDATORY BIOLOGICAL VALIDATION PROTOCOL
biological_validation_protocol:
  pre_analysis_checks:
    - "Review project baseline data (1.21-1.84 turns/min)"
    - "Understand biological constraints (max ~30 turns/min)"
    - "Verify methodology against known correct approaches"
  during_analysis:
    - "Calculate individual track rates using total observation time"
    - "Validate each result against biological range"
    - "Flag any rate >30 turns/min as calculation error"
  post_analysis:
    - "Compare results to project baseline"
    - "Verify stimulus response patterns (2-6× baseline)"
    - "Confirm biological plausibility before reporting"

# CRITICAL LEARNING POINTS
critical_understanding:
  rate_calculation:
    correct: "Rate per minute = total_events / observation_time_minutes"
    wrong: "Rate per minute ≠ cycle_relative_binning * 60"
  biological_context:
    larvae_constraints: "Cannot physically reorient >1-2 times per second"
    project_baseline: "1.21-1.84 turns/min established from June analysis"
    stimulus_response: "Expected 2-6× baseline increase, not 50-90×"
  validation_mandatory:
    error_indicators: "Results >30 turns/min = calculation error"
    biological_range: "All results must be <30 turns/min"
    cross_validation: "Must validate against known project data"

# IMMEDIATE PRIORITY
current_focus: "Implement correct turn rate calculation methodology with mandatory biological validation"
critical_deliverable: "Biologically valid turn rate analysis that matches project baseline expectations"
